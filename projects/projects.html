			<p>I interned at University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies on May 2020 to Aug 2020. My supvisor was <a href="http://kbladin.se/">Mr. Kalle Bladin</a>. My job over the summer was extending ICT's the facial wrapping tool "FaceX" and intergrating the optical flow into the tool to improve the wrapping quality.</p>

					<p align="justify">
						The FaceX is the ICT's own face retopoloty tool. It wraps a commond morphable face model ICT-FaceKit to face geometries. The FaceX wraps the face mesh to the target face geometies using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. I integrated optical flow to the FaceX in order to get more accurate face surface and reduce texture drifting when we blend expressions. Tools & Language: C++, OpenCV, FaceX, and FaceKit.

					<p align="justify">
						I used csg operations (union, intersection, cutout, and shell) and basic implicit shapes to create a figure that is humanoid which had two legs, two arms, and a head. Deep shadow maps is the ray marching algorithm I used. My humanoid was a standing god with Halo who stood on a turntable and held a bunny in a teapot.

						Level set is a special instance of a signed distance function with values on a grid. I implemented the basic level set algorithm to calculate the shortest distance from each grid point to an object on the grid. There are three short level set videos for three different objects which are bunny, teapot, and bunny in the teapot. Both of those level sets have three points lighting scheme. You can found those three videos here: <a href="https://youtu.be/ooKnxrNvFyQ" target="_blank">Bunny</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/BbZrVXarpso" target="_blank">Teapot</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/S4PyrLRasXQ" target="_blank">Bunny in the teapot</a>.

						I created three wedges which are Perlin noise wedge, Pyroclastic Sphere wedge, and Wisp wedge for this project. Each wedge is based on one guide particle, and each frame is a different setting of the indicated parameters (e.g. octaves, frequencies, frequency jumps).  Wisp wedge has 5 million wisp dots in each frame.

			<p>This class was mainly about physically-based modeling for animation and computer graphics. The objectives of this class are investigating Particle Systems, Flocking Systems, Flocking, Rigid Body Simulation, and Fluid Simulation. This class required us to implement those scenarios with the knowledge of Calculus, Physics, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods, and Interactive Graphics. All the programs were written in C++ using OpenGL, GLM, and GLSL to do the graphics and interaction. The class lecturer was <a href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dhouse/">Prof. Donald H. House</a>. You can review the class content <a href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/817/">here</a>.</p>

					<p align="center"><b>Bouncing Ball: Toy Story</b></p>

					<p align="justify">
						This is a fundamental project for physically based animation class. It contains a box with six sides, but some faces are culled based on view angle. The box is texture-mapped with "Toy Story" wall paper. There is a 3D spherical ball bouncing inside the box. The ball's speed is determined by wind and gravity. There is a triangle under the bottom of the box, and the ball is able to bounce with it as well. To interact with the simulator, users can change the wind speed, ball speed, fraction coefficient, wind coefficient etc. The whole scene is lighted by three point lighting setup.

					<p  align="justify" >
						This project extend bouncing ball to a large-scale particle system simulation. The idea is using particles to represent a water fountain. Each particle ball is drawn with billboard technique. I activate the blend functions to blend the alpha channel so that all the particles look more like water. The water fountain has 4 generators. Totally random generator, fountain generator, irrigation generator, and no generator. The water particles can be effected by wind and lights. The water also can be sucked into a vortex.

						It's time for exploring the deep ocean! The main theme of this project is Finding Nemo. This project simulates the flocking system. There are thousands of fish in the scene. In order to optimize the running speed, I used OpenGL instance to draw a fish once and distribute this fish object to each particle. The group of fish can steer by themselves to avoid spheres. Depending on modes set by users, the fish will circle around the sea, flee away, or school together.

						"Everybody was kung-fu fighting! Woo-ha!" Po follows the instructions of the master Shifu and studies so hard so that he can become a real "Dragon Warrior" earlier. Po is made from spring mesh structures. When the program is run, Po will fall off until he hits the "floor", and then he will bounce back and forth. Once Paul settles down, users can turn on the flashing mode, Po will get "Qi" from the universe due to the "Yin" and "Yang".

The flag on the top of the castle was a spring system. The flag could be blown in wind. The fireworks were particle system, which appeared with random colors and at random positions. The Disney castle was painted in the substance painter. I also choreographed the camera movement so that it matched the original clips.

However, I modelled the teddy bear from scrach, created the landscape, choreographed the camera cuts, and rendered the animation. The story of my project is Teddy is a greedy boy. He likes all food around world. He will put everything that he sees into his mouth and tastes its flavor! One day he sees a beehive, he thinks he can have a honey feast. But actually it’s full of poison.
